# Execution phase
## Plan 1 - Move to temp location
### Summary
Moving to a temporary location provides the opportunity to live in an area 
before making the final decision. It also provides the ability to spend more
time exploring and seeing the benefits or downsides to additional areas. 
#### Advantages
 * Try before you buy
 * More time for explortation
 * Ability to make more informed decision
#### Disadvantages :poop: 
 * Delays overall timeline
 * Requires multiple moves
 * Complicates Lucas' job search
### Conway
#### Advantages
 * Closer to family
 * Lower cost than NW AR (likely)
 * Close to NB and LR
 * Close to Josh and Hailey(sp?)
 * Close to good hospitals
 * Good schools
 * Close to LR for Lucas job
#### Disadvantages :poop:
 * Further from NW AR (for scouting)
 * Further from NW AR (for job switching)
 * Further from NW AR (for fun NW AR stuff)
### New Blaine
#### Advantages
 * Lowest cost
 * Central location for NW AR and Central AR
#### Disadvantages :poop:
 * Proximity to better hospitals
 * Proximity to better schools
### Fayetteville
 * Rent home in area
 * Scout other areas while experiencing NW AR
#### Advantages
 * NW AR has lots of fun stuff
 * Close to good hospitals
 * Close to best schools?
 * Possibly most jobs for Lucas
#### Disadvantages :poop:
 * Not close to family
 * Not close to friends (possible)
 * Further from LR (for job switching)
## Plan 2 - Move direct
### Summary
This plan assumes that Lucas' job search is higher priority. Moving directly to
a new location expidites the timeline. It entails making a decision prior to 
leaving Colorado on the (at least) area where you want to live. It does not 
necessarily entail property is purchased, but would entail that a decision is 
made on the area you will live/work.
#### Advantages
 * Shorter timeline
 * Less risk to job search aspect
 * Multiple moves will be shorter distance
#### Disadvantages :poop:
 * Does not allow try-before-you-buy
 * May still imply multiple moves
## How to execute possible plans
## Possible timelines
## Constraints and Limitations

## Possible Locations
### Fayetteville

Fayetteville is in vibrant NW AR which offers many amenities that are not 
found elsewhere in the state. Lots of money has gone into this area and there
